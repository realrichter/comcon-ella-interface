# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements input guardrails for the Ella AI agent to ensure that only contextually relevant requests are processed. The guardrails will filter out requests that are not related to com:con's products, customer companies, or lead generation scenarios, preventing misuse and ensuring focused, business-relevant interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want the Ella agent to only respond to business-relevant queries, so that the system maintains focus on lead generation and customer support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query unrelated to com:con products THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an appropriate message
2. WHEN a user asks about personal topics, homework, or general knowledge unrelated to business integration THEN the system SHALL trigger the guardrail and halt processing
3. WHEN a user submits a query about business systems integration, com:con products, or workflow automation THEN the system SHALL allow the request to proceed to the main agent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear logging and error handling for guardrail violations, so that I can monitor system usage and identify potential misuse patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guardrail is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the violation with appropriate details
2. WHEN a guardrail fails THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly error message explaining why the request was rejected
3. WHEN guardrail processing encounters an error THEN the system SHALL fail safely and log the technical error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the guardrail system to be configurable and maintainable, so that business rules can be updated without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the guardrail logic needs updates THEN the system SHALL allow modification of relevance criteria through configuration
2. WHEN new product categories are added THEN the system SHALL support extending the relevance checking without major refactoring
3. WHEN guardrail performance needs optimization THEN the system SHALL use efficient models and caching where appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want clear feedback when my request is rejected, so that I understand how to ask relevant questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my request is rejected by guardrails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on what types of questions are appropriate
2. WHEN I ask a borderline relevant question THEN the system SHALL either process it or provide clear reasoning for rejection
3. WHEN the guardrail system is unavailable THEN the system SHALL either fail safely or provide degraded service with appropriate warnings
